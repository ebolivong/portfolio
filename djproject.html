                </br><p>DJ Magazine’s Top 100 list has been published annually since 1991. Hundreds and thousands of votes are taken in by polls to rank 100 worldwide DJ’s. I noticed that the DJ Mag website only offers a standard list of these rankings. I wanted to create a visualization that could portray the list in a way that engages and informs viewers all in one. Talk about why age is significant.

                </br></br>The startup page visualizes a scatterplot of all 100 DJ’s in order along with their age. Colour is also used to specify which continent each DJ originated from. For interactive components, the viewer is able to click the legends, origin and/or age, to show only a certain demographic. The second key component is the ability to hover over the points to get basic information of each DJ while reducing opacity of all other points. This infographic offers an overall visualization of the DJ Magazine Top 100 list in an engaging and aesthetic manner.</p>
